ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Avash <br>
Nice to meet you!

I work as an SRE at Cruise, where I am currently working on improving how we do incident response and reporting on insights wrt. reliability of systems and components that ultimately power our self-driving cars! 

Before Cruise, I went to UC Berkeley for grad school (going back to academia was a tough one, specially after 4 years of working in tech!). 

And well, before that, I worked as a Lead Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments.
