    - Led the architecture redesign, implementation, feature upgrades and maintenance for Fidelity’s Fund Information Platform, which serves 100M+ data requests per month for millions of customers.
    - Led efforts to rewrite legacy code (150K+ lines of Java, JSP and Javascript) from a monolithic application to microservices written on Java for backend with Node Express serving Angular for frontend.
    - Proposed and prototyped a proof-of-concept to shift to open-source frameworks from proprietary licensed soft- ware frameworks, bringing the licensing cost down to 0 upon successful implementation of the idea.
    - Redesigned and rewrote the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) solutions to decrease daily batch processing time from 1.5 hours to 12 minutes, significantly decreasing chances of Service Level Agreement breaches.
    - Set up Chaos Engineering on the AWS infrastructure using Gremlin to test and quantify failure scenarios and failover mechanisms. Decreased API error rates by 30% by discovering architecture bottlenecks and fixing them.
    - Mentored junior developers and interns in the team for technical directions and requirement specifications.
  - Software Engineer
    - Developed multiple applications as a full-stack developer rewriting the applications from legacy .NET applica- tions to responsive apps using Java, Node Express, Angular and Oracle PL/SQL.
    - Spearheaded the cloud-migration strategy to align with the enterprise goals to move out of physical data centers.
    - Built the product infrastructure with AWS Cloudformation and built CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment
    of containerized applications, databases (PostgreSQL) and Redis cache.
    - Decreased application infrastructure costs by 60% by setting up autoscaling on the ECS clusters.
    - Led a business-unit wide initiative to adopt modernized CI/CD pipelines. Rebuilt 150+ pipelines that helped
    teams speed up their time-to-market and decrease reliance on Ops teams that exclusively handle legacy products.
